# Overview

This software is a extreme beta version of a program I hope to build in later in my career. This software connects itself to a Google firestore cloud server and stores links to songs that the user is able to enter. From there, the code will take the link, download the song, play the song, and then proceeds to delete the song. The idea behind using cloud storage is that multiple user's can connect and add songs, like a jukebox, hence the name.

I wrote this software once again because it is a extreme beta version of a program I hope to build. I want to solve the problem that every friend group has struggled with, the hassel of getting the aux passed to you. I want to make it so only one person needs to be connected to the aux or even bluetooth and everyone being able to suggest songs that can be played next. This will make song sharing easier and make driving safer as well since the phone will no longer need to be passed around.

# Future Changes

As I have mentioned, this is an extreme beta version of the software I would like to write. A couple of things I would like to work on in the future is incoperating spotify instead of youtube, saving and deleting the music files in the cloud database instead of the main program, and Ultimately I would like to get it on an app instead of just on the computer.
